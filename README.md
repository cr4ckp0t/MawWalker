Maw Walker
==================
This addon will assist you with route planning in The Maw to obtain each of the events and rares in the zone to increase your friendship level with [Ve'nari](https://www.wowhead.com/faction=2432/venari). It does this by loading waypoints into [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom). _TomTom is required to use this addon._
Additionally, there is a command to keep track of your standing with Ve'nari.
